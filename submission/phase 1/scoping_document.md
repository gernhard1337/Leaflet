## INTRODUCTION

The aim of Leaflet is to provide a simple, performant, lightweight JavaScript-Library to enable a simple handling 
for interactive Maps. 
This Document defines severall Requirements that shall be satisfied by Leaflet. 
Those Requirements are created by Reengineering since Leaflet has no Requirement Table till Version 1.8.0 and only 
provides Documentation about the API for Devs.

## Requirements

Requirements are split in 3 Parts. Those reflect the different views on Leaflet. 
Starting with User-Requirements we cover the needs for the Users perspective. It is said that User means here the real user
such as those who will see the results of this library. Followed by the Programmer-Requirements, here are all needs a developer would love to have in the project. Divided from this we have the third Category, technical-Requirements. 
Technical-Requirements include mostly Requirements needed by Developers but not in a way they will be affected by it directly.
